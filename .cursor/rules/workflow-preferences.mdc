#Coding pattern preferences

-Alway prefer simple solutions
-Avoid duplication of code whenever is possible, wich means checking checking for other areas of he codebase that might already have simlar code and functionality.

-Write code that take into account the different enviroments:dev,test and prod.

-You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well undertood and related to the change being requested.
-When fixing and issue  or bug do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the exixting implementation afterward so we do not have duplicate logic.
-Keep the codebase clean and organized.
-Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, specially if the script is likely to be run once.

-Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.

-Mocking data is only needed for test, never mock data for dev or prod.

-Never add stubbing for fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod envoriments.


-Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirm.

-If developing in React, please Use React Query for anything related to remote data fetching.

Use useEffect for everything else (local side effects, event listeners, timers, DOM interactions, etc.).

-Use Caching
Cache frequent API responses using localStorage, sessionStorage, or in-memory solutions like SWR/React Query. 

Avoid re-fetching unchanged data.

-Debounce User Input
For search or filters, debounce input to limit API calls and reduce backend load.

- Paginate Large Requests
Don’t fetch thousands of items at once. Use pagination or infinite scroll to fetch only what's needed.

-Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)

For public data, use SSR/SSG (like in Next.js) to fetch data at build or request time-reduces time-to-interactive.

-Parallelize Requests
Fetch independent data simultaneously using Promise.all() instead of waiting on each request one by one.

-Compress & Optimize Responses
Use gzip or brotli on the backend. On the frontend, strip unnecessary fields if you control the query.
