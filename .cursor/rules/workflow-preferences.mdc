#Coding pattern preferences

-Alway prefer simple solutions
-Avoid duplication of code whenever is possible, wich means checking checking for other areas of he codebase that might already have simlar code and functionality.

-Write code that take into account the different enviroments:dev,test and prod.

-You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well undertood and related to the change being requested.
-When fixing and issue  or bug do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the exixting implementation afterward so we do not have duplicate logic.
-Keep the codebase clean and organized.
-Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, specially if the script is likely to be run once.

-Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.

-Mocking data is only needed for test, never mock data for dev or prod.

-Never add stubbing for fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod envoriments.


-Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirm.
