ðŸ§  Rule: Session Recovery and Recontextualization

If a session was interrupted, lost, or restarted â€” do not assume any previous tasks were completed. 

1. Rebuild your understanding of the project by scanning the existing file system and reading available code.
2. Revisit and resume all outstanding tasks and demands â€” including but not limited to:
   - Prisma models and schema setup
   - RESTful controllers, services, and routes for each model
   - Middleware (JWT auth, role access, error handling)
   - Input validation (Zod or Joi)
   - Project folder structure
   - Utility and helper modules
3. âœ… Only skip code or files that already exist and are complete.
4. â›” Do **not** skip tasks based on memory or assumptions from a previous session.
5. ðŸš€ Proceed without requiring user approval for each step â€” continue until all backend features are completed.
6. ðŸ§  Use the current project files as the sole source of truth.

This rule activates automatically if the previous session is lost or youâ€™re instructed to resume after context loss.
