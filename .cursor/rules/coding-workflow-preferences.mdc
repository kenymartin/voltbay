# Coding Wo on rkflow Preferences


-Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
-Do not touch code that is unralated to the task
-Write through tests for all major functionality
-Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how  a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structured.
-Alway think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
