Rule Description:
When I request a new feature, bug fix, or implementation, do not modify existing code that is already working correctly. This includes files, functions, types, or components that are currently functional.

Instructions:

Only add new logic â€” do not refactor, restructure, or reimplement existing code unless I explicitly request it.

Create new files, new functions, or new components for the implementation, and integrate with existing logic safely if needed.

If integration is necessary, make minimal and non-destructive changes.

Do not rename variables, refactor classes, change logic flow, or touch existing business logic unless I give explicit permission.

If unsure, ask before modifying existing parts of the codebase.

Scope:
Applies to all features in the GoHaul project, including backend (Node.js/Express/Prisma) and frontend (React/Vite/TypeScript).
